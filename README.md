# ALU-Design-project
It is required to design ALU. This ALU can execute arithmetic and  logical operations. The output (arithmetic or  logical) is selected by the MSB of the selection line, while the required operation is selected by  the other 3 bits. It is also required to design flip-flops at the inputs and outputs of the ALU.
